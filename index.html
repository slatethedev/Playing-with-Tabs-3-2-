      <h1>Info</h1>
      <p>VanillaRevived has a rich history behind it.</p>
      <h3>Ever wondered why our server is named that way?</h3>
      <h2>History of VR</h2>
      <p>Before VR existed, me and my friends played on a server called CCMC.</p>
      <p>CCMC was a pay to win server but it had good people on it and everybody spent their time on it.</p>
      <p>I myself bought ranks on ccmc amounting to around $35 in purchases.</p>
      <p>CCMC was only semi active like VR is today, but it allowed for people to really know eachother, like in a small town.</p>
      <p>CCMC had two main gamemodes, vanilla and modded.</p>
      <p>Vanilla mode on ccmc became a good bit inactive, and that's why I lit the fire of vanilla.</p>
      <p>That fire can still be seen at my base at 0,0 and symbolises the health of the server.</p>
      <p>The owner of the server, Fel was with all due respect, a big jerk.</p>
      <p>She spoke to the members in the server with hostility, and for the longest time I wanted to move servers but couldn't because of the friends and things I made on the server.</p>
      <p>CCMC had a few world resets to the dismay of the players.</p>
      <p>My opportunity came when CCMC announced a reset and decided to also change how vanilla worked drastically</p>
      <p>I decided this was a good time to leave, and so I took a world download of everything that was important to me, and left</p>
      <p><em><b>But what about my friends?</b></em></p>
      <p>I went to work, and decided that I could make a small, cheap server for me and my friends.</p>
      <p>I invited my friends to a discord server I made for my project, and Fel found out.</p>
      <p>I was banned from CCMC and any chances of going back were gone so I decided it was a good time to my all of my effort into this fledgling server</p>
      <p>It was done, but my friends got bored so I decided to expand and advertise the server, and boom! VR was now a real server!</p>
      <h2>Now what?</h2>
      <p>I will be what fel was not. I will be a server owner who is kind and compassionate to their members (but i will /smite you) and never fully reset the world, so players can have their builds for years to come.</p>
      <p><b><em>If VR ever fails, you will all get the world download.</em></b></p>
